# Black Hole Notes

## 17 June 2021 presentation

Chern-Simons Gravity modifies the black hole solution. Rotating black holes move through the Chern-Simons gravity.
its neccessary that Black Holes rotate bc of Chern-Simons gravity.Prediction differs from normal general relativity.
in GR the only object of interest is gravitational field that warps space-time.
in C-S Gravity there is amnother physical thing called 'Universal Axion'. It's like a fluid. behaves as a fluid. fluid gets concentrated and flows along at north and south pole. Known as a Chern-Simons cap is a build up of this quantum fluid.
