# Black Hole Notes

## 17 June 2021 presentation

Chern-Simons Gravity modifies the black hole solution. Rotating black holes move through the Chern-Simons gravity.
its neccessary that Black Holes rotate bc of Chern-Simons gravity.Prediction differs from normal general relativity.
in GR the only object of interest is gravitational field that warps space-time.
in C-S Gravity there is amnother physical thing called 'Universal Axion'. It's like a fluid. behaves as a fluid. fluid gets concentrated and flows along at north and south pole. Known as a Chern-Simons cap is a build up of this quantum fluid.

light cones dragging around inside the blackhole in the direction of the movement of the black hole.

rotation turns on
fluid moves to the top.

4 elements needed for three:
  1. A scene that will contain objects
  2. Some objects
  3. A camera
  4. A renderer

Mesh is the combination of a geometry (the shape) and a material (how it looks).

<!-- For BH final: can use 2 cameras to show the the top-down and the side view. only have to build once :) -->
You can have multiple cameras just like on a movie set, and you can switch between those cameras as you please. Usually, we only use one camera.
